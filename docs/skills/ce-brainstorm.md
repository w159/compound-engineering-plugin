# `ce-brainstorm`

> Think through what something should become — collaboratively, one question at a time — then write a right-sized requirements-only unified plan.

`ce-brainstorm` is the **definition** skill. It's a thinking partner that asks one question at a time, pressure-tests your premises against named gap lenses, explores 2-3 concrete approaches before recommending one, and, for software work, produces a requirements-only unified plan strong enough that planning never has to invent product behavior.

It runs equally well on software features, on entirely non-software topics (event planning, business decisions, personal-project framing, travel itineraries, naming briefs), and anywhere in between. The same one-question-at-a-time discipline applies everywhere. Software brainstorms write the requirements-only unified plan artifact; non-software brainstorms stay in facilitation mode and can hand their synthesis to `ce-plan` for a domain-appropriate plan.

This is the middle step in the compound-engineering ideation chain:

```text
/ce-ideate         /ce-brainstorm      /ce-plan             /ce-work
"What's worth      "What does this     "What's needed       "Build it."
 exploring?"        need to be?"        to accomplish
                                        this?"
```

It's also the most common standalone entry point — for any feature, decision, or project where the question isn't "how do I do it?" but "what am I really doing, and is it the right shape?"

One thing it deliberately does *not* do is render a verdict. When a request is really a *whether-to-adopt* decision on a specific external candidate — a named technology, library, pattern, platform, or architecture, judged against this project — `ce-brainstorm` recognizes the shape (at intake or when a brainstorm later narrows to it) and offers to hand off to `/ce-pov` for a decisive, project-grounded verdict, rather than scope something the user hasn't decided to commit to. It's an offer, not a silent switch; open-ended design with no single candidate stays here.

## TL;DR

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What does it do? | Collaborative dialogue to clarify scope, pressure-test premises, explore approaches, and write a requirements-only unified plan |
| When to use it | Vague feature ideas, "let's brainstorm", multiple plausible directions, unclear scope; non-software decisions and projects |
| What it produces | Software: requirements-only unified plan in `docs/plans/` with `artifact_readiness: requirements-only` and R/A/F/AE IDs. Non-software: chat synthesis plus optional handoff to `ce-plan`, not a software unified artifact. |
| What's next | `/ce-plan`, `/ce-work` for trivial scope, doc review, or publish to Proof |

## The Problem

Going straight from a vague idea to implementation produces:

- Code (or work) that solves the wrong problem because nobody pressure-tested the premise
- Scope creep because boundaries were never made explicit
- Plans that re-litigate product decisions every time someone touches them
- Requirements docs that are either over-ceremonial PRDs nobody updates, or one-line briefs that planning has to fill in by guessing

A typical "let's brainstorm" with an AI also has shape problems: it asks five questions in one message; you answer two and the rest get lost. It picks one approach immediately instead of presenting alternatives. It bakes implementation details into product discussion. The output is conversation, not a handoff-able artifact.

## The Solution

`ce-brainstorm` runs a structured but conversational flow that ends in a durable artifact:

- **One question per turn**, even when sub-questions feel related
- **Right-sized ceremony** — Lightweight / Standard / Deep / Deep-product tiers
- **Named gap lenses** force rigor on premises before generating approaches
- **An opt-in blindspot pass** maps the decision surface of territory the user doesn't know before the interview proceeds on it
- **A background grounding scout** gathers verbatim repo evidence on a cheap model while you answer the opening questions
- **2-3 concrete approaches** with tradeoffs, then a stated recommendation
- **Opt-in visual probes** for decisions that are faster to judge as rough sketches than prose
- **Synthesis Summary** as the last opportunity to correct scope before the doc lands
- **Fresh-context claim verification** checks the doc's repo claims before it lands
- **One coherent work unit per artifact** with a plain-language view of how separately planned work currently fits together
- **Ready for Planning Check** repairs completeness, consistency, focus, and planning-readiness defects before handoff
- **Right-sized Product Contract** inside a unified plan with stable identifiers (R/A/F/AE) that flow into planning

## What Makes It Novel

### 1. One question at a time, blocking-tool first

Stacking three questions in one message produces diluted answers. `ce-brainstorm` asks one question per turn, every turn — and defaults to the platform's blocking question tool with single-select options when natural choices exist. Well-chosen options scaffold the answer without confining it (free-text fallback always available).

### 2. Tier classification scales ceremony to the work

Not every brainstorm is the same. Lightweight covers small, well-bounded ideas with low ambiguity. Standard handles normal features with some decisions. Deep adds systemic-move probes for cross-cutting work. Deep-product additionally requires establishing product shape — actors, core outcome, positioning, durability — rather than inheriting it. Ceremony scales with the work, not against it.

### 3. The Product Pressure Test — named gap lenses

Before generating approaches, the skill scans the user's opening for rigor gaps. Each gap has a name and probes the kind of confusion it catches:

- **Evidence** — "users want X" with no observable behavior backing it
- **Specificity** — beneficiary described abstractly; design will silently invent who they are
- **Counterfactual** — no visibility into what users do today, or what changes if nothing ships
- **Attachment** — a specific solution shape is being treated as the thing being built
- **Durability** _(Deep-product only)_ — value rests on a current state of the world that may shift

These probes fire as **prose, not menus** — a 4-option menu signals which kinds of evidence count and lets the user pick rather than produce. Prose forces real observation.

### 4. Approach exploration with non-obvious angles required

Phase 2 surfaces 2-3 concrete approaches with at least one **non-obvious angle** — inversion, constraint removal, or cross-domain analogy. Approaches are presented at mechanism / product-shape granularity, not architecture. (Architecture decisions made on intentionally-shallow research tend to pre-commit you to bad choices; those belong in `ce-plan`.) Approaches are shown before the recommendation so the user sees alternatives without being anchored.

### 5. Display-only visual probes when seeing beats reading

When a decision is spatial, behavioral, or visual, `ce-brainstorm` can offer a choice: keep exploring in text, or create a rough local visual probe. Visual probes are disposable sketches for product feedback, not polished UI, implementation prototypes, or final specs. The artifact is display-only; the user responds in chat.

### 6. Synthesis Summary — the last cheap moment to correct

Before writing the doc, `ce-brainstorm` emits a **scoping synthesis** shaped like what two product collaborators would confirm before writing a PRD. It surfaces what's being built, the key trade-offs the dialogue produced, what's been deferred, and any genuine forks the user should weigh in on. Each section renders only when it has something to say — no empty buckets padded for ceremony. The synthesis compresses to a single forward-looking sentence with an end-of-turn interrupt window **only** for a Lightweight brainstorm that asked no blocking questions. Every other case — Standard or Deep tier, or any tier that asked a blocking question — gets the full scoping synthesis with an explicit confirmation gate, including a richly pre-loaded Phase 0.2 fast path that needed no dialogue: pre-loaded substance earns a real checkpoint rather than a one-sentence preview.

### 7. Stable identifiers that flow downstream

The Product Contract carries plan-feeding identifiers — R-IDs (Requirements), A-IDs (Actors), F-IDs (Key Flows), AE-IDs (Acceptance Examples). `ce-plan` consumes these and traces every implementation unit and test scenario back to them. Origin scope boundaries (especially "Outside this product's identity") flow through unchanged.

### 8. Universal brainstorming for non-software

Building a software feature? Standard flow. Naming a product? Choosing a vacation? Deciding a career move? `ce-brainstorm` routes to a domain-agnostic facilitator that preserves the one-question-at-a-time discipline and right-sized output.

### 9. Implementation kept out of the Product Contract by default

Requirements describe **what** behavior is expected from the user's perspective. They do not describe libraries, schemas, endpoints, file layouts, or code structure — unless the brainstorm is itself about a technical or architectural decision. This keeps planning's job clean: invent the **how**, not the **what**.

### 10. Blindspot pass for unfamiliar territory

The interview machinery assumes you can evaluate what it asks — and that assumption fails exactly when you're scoping work in territory you don't know. When you flag unfamiliarity ("I know nothing about the auth modules", "I don't know what color grading is"), or consecutive answers show you *can't weigh the options* rather than merely haven't decided, `ce-brainstorm` offers a **blindspot pass** before questioning you further on that territory: a grounded map of 3-7 decisions and hazards you didn't know to ask about, each with why it matters for your topic, the realistic options, and a recommended default. You pick which to walk through; the rest take defaults recorded as explicit assumptions. It converts unknown unknowns into known unknowns, so the interview extracts choices instead of guesses. Works on both the software and non-software routes.

### 11. Session-settled decisions carried into requirements

The same settlement test runs at requirements time: a decision the user examined and chose during the dialogue (a tradeoff was surfaced, they chose with it in view) lands as a labeled Key Decision — `session-settled: user-directed` or `user-approved`, naming what it was chosen over — and the dialogue never re-asks it. `ce-plan` enrichment inherits the label and its rejected-alternative provenance, so a choice made once here isn't re-litigated when the requirements become an implementation-ready plan.

### 12. Grounding and verification ride inside your think-time

On Standard and Deep brainstorms, a cheap extraction-tier scout is dispatched in the background while you answer the first question. It writes a grounding dossier — verbatim quotes with `file:line` pointers — to scratch storage and hands back a short gist, so the dialogue stays lean while the evidence stays available on demand. Before the requirements-only unified plan is written, a fresh-context verifier (a mid-tier model that never saw the dialogue) checks the Product Contract's repo claims — absence claims, file references — against the codebase, running while you review the synthesis confirmation. Refuted claims are corrected before the plan lands; unverifiable ones become explicit assumptions. The dossier path is handed to `ce-plan` so planning starts from verified quotes instead of re-scanning. On platforms without per-agent model selection, both run on the inherited model with the same read budgets; with no subagent support at all, the skill falls back to inline scanning and verification.

## Quick Example

You start with a vague feature idea — "I want to add a way for users to pause notifications." `ce-brainstorm` reads the project's constraint files, classifies the work as Standard scope, and sends a cheap background scout to gather repo evidence while you answer the first question.

The pressure test detects a specificity gap (who are these "users"?) and an attachment gap ("pause" is already a specific solution shape). It probes both as prose, one at a time. You name the actual pain — your support team gets pinged at 3 AM for non-urgent stuff — and describe the smallest version that would solve it.

Three approaches surface — per-notification-type mute with TTL, a global do-not-disturb schedule, mute on the rule rather than the channel — with tradeoffs and a recommendation. The Synthesis Summary reads back the shape that emerged ("per-channel mute on notification rules, 24h preset for the 3 AM support pings"), names the trade-offs made in dialogue (per-channel over per-user, mute lives on the rule), what's deferred (presence-based mute, quiet-hours schedules), and a single call-out about the rule-delete loss path. You confirm and add a 24h preset.

A requirements-only unified plan is written under `docs/plans/` and the Phase 4 menu offers next steps — `/ce-plan` (recommended), Product Contract review, publish to Proof, or skip-to-build only for trivial scope with a sufficient Definition of Done.

## When to Reach For It

Reach for `ce-brainstorm` when:

- A feature idea is partially formed but you can't yet sketch the implementation
- A request has multiple valid solutions and you need to choose
- The scope is unclear ("add notifications" — what kind? for whom? when?)
- You want a structured artifact you can hand to another contributor or to planning
- A vague problem statement needs to become a real product decision
- You have to scope work in territory you don't know — the blindspot pass maps the decision surface before questions begin
- You're working on something non-software (named products, roadmap choices, decisions)

Skip `ce-brainstorm` when:

- You don't yet know what to work on → `/ce-ideate` first
- Requirements are already specified (PRD exists, GitHub issue is detailed) → `/ce-plan` directly
- You have a known root cause for a bug → `/ce-debug`
- The change is trivial and obvious → just do it

## Use as Part of the Chained Workflow

```text
/ce-ideate          (optional — discover candidate directions)
   |  picks one survivor + carries warrant + rationale
   v
/ce-brainstorm
   |  produces requirements-only unified plan
   |  software mode: R-IDs, A-IDs, F-IDs, AE-IDs + scope boundaries
   |  universal mode: a domain-appropriate brief
   v
/ce-plan
   |  enriches the same plan to implementation-ready
   |  R-IDs flow into Requirements; A/F/AE-IDs trace into units and tests
   |  origin scope boundaries are preserved verbatim
   v
/ce-work
```

When `ce-plan` loads with a requirements-only unified plan as input, it does not re-litigate product behavior. The Product Contract is authoritative. Plan-time decisions are about execution guardrails — not what's being built.

---

## Use Standalone

`ce-brainstorm` is the most common standalone entry point. Many teams skip `ce-ideate` (they already know what to explore) and skip `ce-plan` (the brainstorm is their full thinking artifact).

- **Feature briefs** — turn a vague idea into a stable artifact for stakeholders or new contributors
- **Onboarding existing work** — when a feature is in flight but the rationale was never written down
- **Pre-PR alignment** — when multiple people need to agree on scope before code starts
- **Strategic decisions** — Deep-product tier surfaces durability and adjacent-product risks
- **Non-software brainstorms** — name a product, plan an event, decide a roadmap

The Phase 4 handoff offers planning, agent doc review, publish to Proof, direct-to-work for lightweight scope, more clarifying questions, or pause.

## Reference

| Argument | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| _(empty)_ | Asks for the feature description |
| `<feature idea>` | Open-ended brainstorm |
| `<problem>` | Routes via the product pressure test |
| Existing requirements-only plan path, legacy `*-requirements.md` path, or topic | Resume offer |
| `output:html` | Write the requirements-only unified plan as a single self-contained HTML file instead of markdown. Exclusive — the artifact is `.md` OR `.html`, never both. Default is markdown. Set `brainstorm_output: html` in `.compound-engineering/config.local.yaml` to make HTML the default. Pipeline mode (LFG, `disable-model-invocation`) always forces markdown so downstream automation gets a stable text shape. See the [configuration reference](./configuration.md). |

## FAQ

**Why one question at a time? Isn't that slow?**
Stacking three questions per turn produces diluted answers — users pick the easy one and the rest get lost. One question per turn produces sharper answers and is empirically faster to convergence.

**Why does it pressure-test my premise? I just want to brainstorm.**
The named gap lenses catch the most common ways feature briefs fail downstream. They fire only when the gap is actually present in your opening — a concrete, well-framed prompt may earn zero probes.

**Can I skip the requirements-only plan?**
Yes. The Lightweight tier and the announce-mode fast path support that. If you only need brief alignment, no doc is written.

**What if I already have a PRD or detailed GitHub issue?**
Skip `ce-brainstorm` and go directly to `/ce-plan`. The plan skill consumes any kind of input.

**What does "Inferred" mean in the synthesis?**
The agent composes an internal three-bucket draft (Stated / Inferred / Out of scope) as a thinking step before presenting the scoping synthesis. Inferred items are the agent's bets to fill dialogue gaps. Those that survive the keep test surface as call-outs in the scoping synthesis; the rest dissolve into the Product Contract when the user confirms.

**Does it work for non-software topics?**
Yes — a domain-agnostic facilitator preserves the one-question-at-a-time discipline and right-sizing for naming, decisions, planning, etc.

## Model elevation

When you want a specific model for the heavy reasoning step, `ce-brainstorm` can generate approaches on a model you choose instead of your session model. It dispatches only approach generation to that model, with read access so it can verify its brief; the rest of the skill stays on your session model. Choose per run by naming a model in your prompt ("use fable", "have opus generate these"), or set a default with `brainstorm_model: <model>` in `.compound-engineering/config.local.yaml`. A prompt request overrides the config key.

This works on any harness: the host serves the chosen model natively where it can, otherwise it invokes the Claude CLI (which must be installed and authenticated), otherwise it runs the step on your session model and tells you which precondition was unmet. **Setting `brainstorm_model` therefore takes effect in every harness you run `ce-brainstorm` in**, not just Claude Code. See `references/reasoning-elevation.md`.
